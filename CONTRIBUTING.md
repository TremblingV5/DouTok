# How to contribute

## Issue & Discussion

Any issues and discussions are welcome. Feel free for submit an issue or open a discussion.

If you want to submit an issue, we suggest that use the given issue templates. Of course, you can also submit one without any templates or using any other templates. The first goal is to make everyone understand your ideas.

## Pull Request

We use git-flow as our branch organization, as known as FDD.

At least, if you want to open a pull request you should follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Do something & write some code
4. Commit and push
5. Open a pull request

For a better flow to manage PRs, we suggest that:

1. Use the given PR templates
2. Use `rebase` to resolve conflicts
3. Submit as few commit as possible in a PR
4. Use a linter to check code before open a PR
